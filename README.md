# windows-MetroLike-AutoTileFlipper
a small javascript that flip images on web page like windows metro style tiles.

Use index.html as an example of putting image blocks onto webpage.

Currently the Flipper flips one image block at a time, which makes a pain in the ass while there are too many blocks on the same page, ideal would be that random number of images maybe flipped at the same time.
